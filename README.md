# PHP Constructors upgrade

This is automatic script that convers old PHP v4 style constructor to a standard PHP v5 __construct(). I know that code is not pretty but honestly it doesn't have to be for this :)

Just type in shell (with trailing slash)

php index.php /absolute/path/to/your/root/folder/

And there you go, now there is no need for discussion about removing old style constructors in PHP v7.

BACKUP YOUR FILES BEFORE USING THIS SCRIPT!

Disclaimer: If anything goes wrong, ofcourse it's your fault :)
